# Pseudoknot Prediction Benchmarking

## About The Project

This module is for the final paper of Algorithms for Structural Bioinformatics.

By Andrew Smith

### Prerequisites

Python3

Prediction programs installed and on path: pknots, pknotsRG, knotty, knotfold, and probknot. This requires a special version of knotfold that is available upon request from the author. These programs are available on GitHub with the exception of probknot, which can be found at https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructureDownload.html.

## Usage

Run the run_test module as the main module. To generate graphs, use the modules in the analysis folder.

```sh
python3 run_test.py
```
